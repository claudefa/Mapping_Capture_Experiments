## Endogenous or hDNA Quantification to prepare equi-endogenous pools for cature 

**Step 0** - Demultiplexing ##### Production reads #####  
```bash
bash hDNA/Step0_demultiplex.sh # previousy you have to gather the barcode information per pool  
bgzip *.fastq   
mv *gz FASTQ/Demultiplex/  
```
**Step 1** - Trimming adapters  #####  
```bash
bash Step1_trimmingAdaptors_hDNA.sh # Here I do not collapse reads since I am only interested on how many of reads map  
```
**Step 2** - Mapping ##### Mapped reads #####  
```bash
bash hDNA/Step2_mapping_hg19_hDNA.sh  
```
**Step 3** - Remove Duplicates ##### Unique reads ####  
```bash
bash hDNA/Step3_rmdupsPicard_hg19_hDNA.sh  
```
**Step 4** - Filtering by quality, remove secondary aligmnets, unmapped ##### Reliable reads #####  
```bash
bash hDNA/Step4_filterQual_hg19_hDNA.sh  
```
**Step 5** - Count number of reads in each step, I count the FIRST in pair #####  
```bash
zcat FASTQs/Demutliplex/${sample}_1.fastq.gz | wc -l # count production reads --> then divide by 4  
bash hDNA/Step5_STATS_hDNA.sh  
```
**Step 6** - Add all the previously collected information in an spread sheet hDNA=RR/PR #####  

***Disclaimer: If number of production reads is very different between libraries, it might be wise to downsample to the same amount of reads/library***  

## Processing of captured data  

**Step 0** - Demultiplexing ##### Production reads #####  
```bash
bash Capture/Step0_demultiplex.sh # previousy you have to gather the barcode information per pool  
```
**Step 1** - Trimming adapters  #####  
```bash
bash Capture/Step1_trimmingAdaptors_FastP.sh # If sequenced in 2x150bp and the insert size is small, collapse reads  
```
**Step 2** - Mapping ##### Mapped reads #####  
```bash
bash Capture/Step2_mapping_hg19_pe.sh # mapping pair end reads  
bash Capture/Step2_mapping_hg19_se.sh # mapping single end reads  
```
*Step 2.1* - Merging single end and paired end data #####  
```bash
bash Capture/Step2.1_merge_pese.sh  
```
*Step 2.2* - Merging - Optional, if same library has been captured in diff pools or sequenced in different lanes #####  
```bash
bash Capture/Step2.2_mergeLib.sh  
```
**Step 3** - Remove Duplicates ##### Unique reads ####  
```bash
bash Capture/Step3_rmdupsPicard_hg19.sh  
```
**Step 4** - Filtering by quality, remove secondary aligmnets, unmapped ##### Reliable reads #####  
```bash
bash Capture/Step4_filterQual_hg19.sh  
```
**Step 5** - Extract OnTarget Reads intersecting with BED file ##### OnTarget reads #####  
```bash
bash Capture/Step5_Ontarget_hg19.sh  
```
**Step 6** - Count number of reads in each step #####  
```bash
zcat FASTQs/Demutliplex/${sample}_1.fastq.gz | wc -l # count production reads --> then divide by 4  
bash Capture/Step6_STATS.sh # here one can decide to do stats per indvidiual hybridization (process everthing without merging the reads from multiple hyb) or total (after merging from different hyb)  
```
**Step 7** - Add all the previously collected information in an spread sheet hDNA=RR/PR #####
